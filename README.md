# SDL2-Pong-CPP

This is a simple ping pong game as you expect. It was created
for understanding game development with C++ and SDL2. There are a few random glitches. Feel free to smash those bugs. Suggestions and best practices are welcome. The game isn't fully complete and I don't plan to complete it. I'm moving on to the next game.
